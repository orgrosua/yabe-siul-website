[Oxygen](https://oxygenbuilder.com/) is the ultimate visual site builder for WordPress & WooCommerce. Use Oxygen's unparalelled power, flexibility, and light-weight code to visually design your WordPress or WooCommerce site with ease.

## Using Tailwind CSS in Oxygen

The Yabe Siul first-class integration with Oxygen allows you to use Tailwind CSS directly in Oxygen editor.

Start type the Tailwind's class name in the Oxygen editor, and the element on the canvas will be styled accordingly.

### Oxybender

Yabe Siul is platform-agnostic. To ensure the development flexibility, we have seperated some Oxygen specific features into a separate plugin called **Yabe Oxybender**. This plugin is free and open-source. Visit https://oxybender.yabe.land for more information.

### Plain Classes

:::note
Requires [**Oxybender**](#oxybender) plugin.
:::

Plain Classes is a field in the Oxygen editor that allows you to add custom classes to Oxygen elements without adding the class to the Global Class database.

Once installed, you will see the `⚡` icon on the element panel.

### Autocomplete class names

:::note
Requires [**Oxybender**](#oxybender) plugin.
:::

The Tailwind CSS cheat sheet is right on your visual builder editor. This makes it easy to use Tailwind CSS in Oxygen.

As you type on the [Plain Classes](#plain-classes) field, Tailwind class names will be suggested automatically. You can use the arrow keys to navigate through the suggestions and press Enter to select the class name.

To enable this feature, you can go to `Yabe Siul → Settings` and open the `General` panel. Then, tick the `Enable engine integration` checkbox.
