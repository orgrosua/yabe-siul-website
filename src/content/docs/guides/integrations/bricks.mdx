## Using Tailwind CSS in Bricks

The Yabe Siul first-class integration with Bricks allows you to use Tailwind CSS directly in Bricks editor.

Start type the Tailwind's class name in the Bricks editor, and the element on the canvas will be styled accordingly.


### Plain Classes

Plain Classes is a field in the Bricks editor that allows you to add custom classes to Bricks elements without adding the class to the Global Class database.

You will see the `âš¡` icon on the element panel.
