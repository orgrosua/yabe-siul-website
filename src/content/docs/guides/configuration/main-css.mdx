When you need to add truly custom CSS rules to the project, the easiest approach is to just add the custom CSS into the `main.css` file. It acts as the primary stylesheet reference for Tailwind CSS when it creates the styles.

To customize the `main.css` file, you can go to `Yabe Siul â†’ Tailwind CSS` and open the `main.css` panel.
