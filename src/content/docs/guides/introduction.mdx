[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is one of the [most popular](https://2023.stateofcss.com/en-US/css-frameworks/) CSS frameworks in the world besides Bootstrap. It is known for its utility-first approach which is both user-friendly and easy to use, making it a top choice for developers. Additionally, its flexible configuration allows developers to customize it to their needs, making it a go-to option for many projects.

However, the use of Tailwind CSS in WordPress is still limited to theme usage, and it requires a development environment that supports build-tools. The increasing popularity of WordPress page builders like Gutenberg, Elementor, Oxygen, and Bricks has created a high demand for integrating Tailwind CSS directly into WordPress without the need for a development environment that supports build tools.

## What is Yabe Siul?

Yabe Siul is a plugin that integrates Tailwind CSS with WordPress. It can be used with page builders, themes, and plugins in any WordPress environment, including shared hosting.

Siul is an Indonesian word that means "whistle".
